# Exec Plans

Use this file as the active execution plan for non-trivial work.

## How To Use

- Replace the template below for each new task
- Keep exactly one active plan unless parallel work is intentional
- Update statuses/checkpoints as work progresses
- Record verification results before marking the plan complete
- Archive important finished plans elsewhere if needed
