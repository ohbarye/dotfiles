Please commit the changes with a clear and concise message in Japanese.

1. Check the staged git changes. If there are none, add relevant files to the staging area using `git add <file>`. Make sure to specify files with logically grouped changes, such as `git add <file1> <file2>` or `git add <directory>/`, etc. Avoid using `git add .` or `git add -A`.
2. Create a concise git commit title that is 50 characters or less. Prefix it with `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, or `tests:` as appropriate.
3. Write a commit body that explains **WHY** we made the changes in detail, including any relevant issue numbers if applicable, with a maximum of 70 characters per line.
4. Commit the changes with both the title and body included.
